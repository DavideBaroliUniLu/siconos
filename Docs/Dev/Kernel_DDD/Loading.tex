There are two ways to give data to the platform, XML file and creating platform's object with
the right data in a program. That we will see here is the management of the input data and the
creation of the platform with these information.
Each object of the platform has a "create" method used in the two cases.

\section{XML input file}
When a XML file bring the data needed by the platform, either all the data are given by the XML
file or only required data. When the file contains partial data, that means it describe at least
a SiconosModel with a NSDS (Non Smooth Dynamical System), composed of at least one Dynamical
System.
\subsection{XML file only}
The reading of the file generate a DOM tree in memory with all the data. Then the creation of the XML management "platform" based on
the DOM tree is based on this tree.
The XML platform belongs to the Model, which is the main object of the platform. That's from the
Model that the creation process is launched to build the platform.
From this point, the Model creates the NSDS, which one creates the dynamical systems, ... The
building is "top down" and gradually, with the Model at the top of the platform.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
The "create" methods used are partially shown in the diagram \ref{fig: platform's loading1}.

\subsection{Partial XML file}
This means that the data read in the file are supplemented with information given in the command
program.
In this case, the XML file is similar to the previous case, then the way to create objects of
the platform apart from a XML file will be detailed in the next section.

\section{Whitout XML input file}
It is possible to create the objects of the platform without a XML file by using the API of the platform.
The methods given to the users allow the creation of each object of the platform. The
unfolding of the building of the platform's architecture is described in the next sequence diagram.

	\caption{Sequence diagram of the platform's loading without XML file}
	\label{fig: platform's loading2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The construction of the platform we can see in the diagram \ref{fig: platform's loading2} is lead by an user. And the same
"createXxxxx" functions are used, like with a XML file.

\section{The creation process}
It is based on the "create" functions which aim to initialize the relating object. They fill its fields with XML data and
link the objects belonging to it to their corresponding XML object, or, if the platform is manually built, only fill
its fields with the data given in paramaters.
