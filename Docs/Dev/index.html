<h2>Mission and Scope</h2>

<h3>What is the purpose and scope of this document ?</h3>

<p>This document aims at presenting a general description of the <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V4</a> 
software. It describes, in a very general way, the major objectives of the
software and the major constraints of development and exploitation. It is
addressed to users and software framework builders.</p>

<h3>What is the scope of this project?</h3>

<p><a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> is a methodology and a software environment dedicated to the design
and the implementation of advanced robotics control systems. It also allows
the specification and the validation of missions. <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> is mainly oriented
towards critical real-time applications in robotics. Here, automatic control
issues are strongly connected with discrete-event aspects. Such systems are
called hybrid systems. </p>

<p>In this class of applications, <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> is particularly concerned with
systems which strongly interact with their environment, through several
actuators and sensors. The control architecture of such systems is generally
on board, and the criticality of the application is emphasized by the very
high direct or indirect cost associated with a failure: since it is difficult
or even impossible to physically intervene on a long range automatic
underwater vehicle, or on an autonomous rover working on a contaminated site,
it is necessary to minimize a priori the risk of non achievement of a
mission. For that purpose, <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> provides the user with dedicated interfaces
ensuring the safety of programming, and has capabilities of validation,
either by formal verification or by extensive simulation.</p>

<p>More details on this software will be found on the website of the Project
<a href="http://orccad.gforge.inria.fr">http://orccad.gforge.inria.fr</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV4">ORCCAD V4</a> is developped jointly by Pop-Art, Sed from INRIA
Rh√¥ne-Alpes and Trasys Space.</p>

<h3>What are the main objectives and motivations ?</h3>
<dl>
    <dd><a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> is about 15 years old project and since 1998, the software
      <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V3</a> was not be upgraded to a major release. The main objective of
      <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV4">ORCCAD</a> V4 is to completly rewrite the software keeping the basic ideas
      (<a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> approaches).</dd>
</dl>
  <dd>Besides the standard features which are required for illustrating the
    <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> approaches, the objectives of this project are of the following :
    <ul>
      <li>To be open to current methods and tools of controller modelization
        (Scilab/Scicos, Matlab/Simulink, UML,...)</li>
      <li>To support exchanges and comparisons of methods between
        researchers. In particular, in the distributed and real-time robot
        controller domain.</li>
      <li>To disseminate the know-how to other fields of research and
        industry.</li>
      <li>To take into account the diversity of users (end users, experts,
        software developers, framework builders, industrial users, etc ...
      ).</li>
      <li>To ensure software quality by the use of modern software design
        methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

<h3>What is the exploitation context ?</h3>

<p>Compared to other systems dedicated to this class of applications, <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a>
offers a coherent and full solution, from the high level specification to the
generation of real-time code. It can also been customized to fulfill the
requirements of a particular problem. The tool is open to general purpose
tools (Scilab/Scicos, Matlab/Simulink, UML,...). </p>

<p>Through dedicated interfaces, and in relation with software tools adapted
to every design level, <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by an <strong>engineer or a scientist</strong> in charge of launching
    the system in view of a given application: for instance, he can describe
    the mission of an underwater observation robot in terms of combination of
    elementary behaviors associated with recovery procedures; macro
    simulations and formal verifications can also be performed from the
    resulting specification;</li>
  <li>by an <strong>expert in automatic control</strong> who has to design
    the elementary actions, to implement and tune the feedback loops and to
    specify the event-driven behavior of these actions; validation tools can
    also be connected at this level; besides, tool boxes like predefined
    control schemes or robot models are available;</li>
  <li> by a <strong>computer scientist, expert in real-time issues,</strong>
    who defines the target architecture and the related communication and
    execution aspects; code generators and simulation tools will allow him to
    verify the validity of his technological choices.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html#Orccad">ORCCAD</a> software should be used as
well by research academic teams as by industry. Currently, <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V3</a> is used
in three ways :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research for Pop-Art to experiment :
    <ul>
      <li>distributed and real-time robot controller</li>
      <li>validation of missions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Robots controller (Biped robot) for Sed.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Demonstrators for Trasys Space :
    <ul>
      <li>project XXX to test controller for a ESA Mars Rover</li>
      <li>project XXX of visual servoing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV4">ORCCAD V4</a>, we expect to replace the <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V3</a> use and to adress
new research academic teams.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V3</a> is obsolete and is not distributed due to license problems.
<a href="glossary.html#OrccadV4">ORCCAD V4</a> is currently under specification, a first public version will be
ready for October 2006.</p>
