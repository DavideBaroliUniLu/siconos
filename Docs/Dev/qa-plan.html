<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br />
The purpose of the quality assurance plan is to check that the project is
consistent with standards and plans which are defined below. The Quality Plan
is divided in three parts :
<ul>
  <li>The software Project Management Plan.</li>
  <li>The software Configuration Management Plan.</li>
  <li>The software Verification and Validation Plan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Management Plan</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Software project management is 'the process of planning, organizing,
staffing, monitoring, controlling and leading a software project'. <br />
This part defines the project management plan of <a
href="glossary.html#OrccadV3">ORCCAD V4</a> software. The project
organization and the major features of the technical process are defined.
Finally, a work breakdown structure, a schedule with milestones are provided.

<h3><a name="Project_Organisation"></a>Project Organization<br />
</h3>

<p>The organization of the project is relatively simple. The teams for the
design and the development are defined as follows :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Team INRIA :
    <dl compact="compact">
    </dl>
    <ul>
      <li>Roger Pissard-Gibollet (RPG) (Technical Team Leader) Roger
        Pissard-Gibollet@inrialpes.fr</li>
      <li>Daniel Simon (DSI) (Scientific Team Leader)
        Daniel.Simon@inrialpes.fr</li>
      <li>Soraya Arias (SAR) (Senior Developper)</li>
      <li>Cristophe Junke (CJU)(Junior Developper) (01/2006 to 09/2006)</li>
      <li>Hatem Houichi (HHO) (Junior Developper) (01/2006 to 09/2006)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Team TRASYS SPACE:
    <dl compact="compact">
    </dl>
    <ul>
      <li>Konstantinos Kapellos (KK) (Team Leader)
        Konstantinos.Kapellos@trasys.be</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Technical Process for the ORCCAD V4 Software</h3>
<br />


<p>The section below focuses on the technical process for software process</p>

<h4>Process model</h4>

<h5>Project outputs</h5>

<p>The outputs to software project planning are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project Document respecting Ready-set template with three major parts
    <ul>
      <li><a href="srs.html">software specification</a></li>
      <li><a href="design.html">design</a> documents</li>
      <li><a href="qa-plan.html">Quality Assurance Plan</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="srs.html">software specification</a> and <a
    href="design.html">design</a> documents</li>
  <li>Quality report <br />

    <ul>
      <li>Code and Documentation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Global life cycle</h5>

<p>We choose an incremental delivery approach. The software is delivered in
multiple releases, each with increased functionality and capability. This may
occurs when certain functions may need to be in place before others can be
effective. <br />
</p>

<p>During each increment, software requirements and architectural design
documents are reviewed and may be lightly corrected. Detailed design, user
manual and testing plans are completed as the work gradually progresses. <br
/>
</p>

<p>This life-cycle was chosen for this project because the <a
href="glossary.html#Orccad/Kernel">Orccad/Kernel</a> and basic
functionnalities of the software have to be validated before the development
of specific plugins or of a smart interface. <br />
</p>

<h5>First increment : software prototype</h5>

<p>This prototype will be realized (CJU, HHO) by two students in computer
sciences during their final training course. From January to September 2005,
they realized a complete increment cycle and they considered this first
increment as a complete project development from user requirements
elicitation to acceptance tests.</p>

<h4>Models / UML methods and Diagram</h4>

<p>To build a good architecture of the platform, we will use various modeling
languages and tools. According to the type of information, we want to depict,
the appropriate model to formally represent data, functions, and behaviours
of our system.</p>

<p>The uml diagrams are numerous and can modelise lots of relations of the
platform to define an adapted architecture to this platform.</p>
<ul>
  <li>uml diagrams. <br />
    We will use uml tools to create uml diagrams. With uml, we can modelise a
    big part of the architecture with the numerous uml diagrams we will see
    further, and with ocl.
    <ul>
      <li>Sequence diagram <br />
        This diagram shows the links of the different actions we can find in
        the platform. It represents the interactions between the entities of
        the system.</li>
      <li>State diagram <br />
        This diagram aims to represent automatons as state graphs. It shows
        the changes of state of an object or a module in response to the
        interactions.</li>
      <li>Collaboration diagram <br />
        This diagram shows the interactions between the objects (instances of
        classes and actors). It allows to represent the context of an
        interaction.</li>
      <li>Classes diagram <br />
        These diagram are collections of classes which show the structure of
        a model. We use several diagrams for complex models.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Description by increment production</h3>
<br />


<p>We will described, in the following section, the increments of software
production, and which functionnalities are implemented.</p>

<h4>First Increment Production</h4>
Code production (single task) with XML specification by hand without GUI.
<dl compact="compact">
  <dt>Orccad/Kernel<br />
  </dt>
    <dd><a href="features.html#F-1.000">F-1.000</a><br />

      <a href="features.html#F-1.002">F-1.002</a><br />
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Second Increment Production</h4>
Code production (mulitple tasks) with XML specification by hand without GUI.

<h4>Third Increment Production</h4>
Code production (single task) with GUI.

<h2>Configuration Management Plan</h2>

<h3>Tool for configuration management : Subversion</h3>
We use <a href="subversion.tigris.org">subversion</a> as a revision control
system. Subversion is an open-source revision control system, which aims to
be a compelling replacement for CVS.<br />


<p>The following rules have to be respected by all users of Orccad SVN server
:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write logs in english</li>
  <li>Except very particular cases, commit only sources which succesfully
    compiles (and pass tests for the code). This rule is valid as much for
    documents as source code.</li>
  <li>Correct possible conflicts before committing your work.</li>
  <li>Documents and Web are stored on SVN server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documents</h3>
<br />


<p>The documents concerned by this section are official project documents,
such as <a href="srs.html">Software requirements specification</a> and <a
href="design.html">design</a> documents. These documents are written in
english and the last validated version must be downloadable on <a
href="http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/Orccad/">Orccad Gforge web site</a> in
a PDF format file. After each major update , a document must be validated by
a team leader and its version number increased. The current version of these
document is available on SVN project server.</p>
<br />


<h2>Verification and Validation Plan</h2>
<dl>
</dl>

<h3>Introduction and contents</h3>

<p>The Verification and Validation plan is divided into two phases :</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Unit testing Plan</b>: In the phase of unit tests, one verify that
    the software subsystems and components work correctly in isolation. The
    set of unit tests are defined for each increment in the section <a
    href="#Unit_testing_plan">Unit testing Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>System and Acceptance testing plan</b>: In the phase acceptance
    tests, one verify that the software system meets the software
    requirements. The set of acceptance tests are defined for each increment
    in the section <a href="#System_and_Acceptance_testing_plan">System and
    Acceptance testing Plan</a></li>
</ol>

<p>These verification activities demonstrate compliance specifications. This
may be done by showing that the product: performs as specified; contains no
defects that prevent it performing as specified.</p>

<p>The results of the verification and validation plan will be found in the
qr.</p>

<h3>Organisation of the reviews to meet the plan</h3>

<p>Reviews and meeting are regularly organized to present the work done.
People concerned by these reviews are all the team members.</p>

<p>Audio-conference are organised between the INRIA and TRASYS</p>

<p>During these reviews, the accomplished work is presented and present
people must have read the new or modified documents.<br />
</p>

<h3><a name="Unit_testing_plan"></a>Unit testing plan</h3>

<p>The tool used to do the unit tests is <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit">JUnit</a>. JUnit allows to
make test suites on each independant module which must be tested.</p>

<p>For each tested module, the unitary tests have to be performed
successfully before validating changes in the software.</p>
