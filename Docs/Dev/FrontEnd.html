<h3>Python Interface<br>
</h3>
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language. In python, Siconos platform is used as a library. When
loaded, almost all Siconos/Kernel functions are available. This
provides a direct and interactive way for computation with Siconos,
without any re-compilation of&nbsp; input-file. <br>
A complete example using python interface is available in
sample/BouncingBall directory, and launched by typing " pySiconos <a
 href="../../sample/BouncingBall/BouncingBall.py">BouncingBall.py</a>
". <br>
To find more on Python, see <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>.
<br>
<h4>C++ - Python wrapper choice<br>
</h4>
To produce the interface, Siconos/Kernel function and class has to be
embedded in Python. There mainly exists two free tools to wrap C++ code
with python
: <br>
Swig and Boost. <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swig&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.swig.org/">(http://www.swig.org/)</a>:</span>
    <p>SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs
written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages. SWIG is <br>
used with different types of languages including
common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and Ruby. </p>
    <p>The main task to connect C++ with Python using SWIG is to
write an interface file. It references the header files that must be
wrap and some<br>
types declarations for the data structures that cannot be
directly and automatically wrapped. </p>
    <p>SWIG is really easy to use, but does not support every features
of advanced C++, especially:&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>friend functions </li>
      <li>overloaded operators with the same number of parameters
and close types (int / double, etc.). </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Boost (<a
 href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a>):</span>
    <p>Boost is a complete framework for C++ which provides
advanced features and completes the Standard Template Library. Its
Python wrapper<br>
is only one functionality among many others.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
For the development of the Kernel-Python interface,&nbsp;
SWIG&nbsp; has been chosen because of its easiest use. Moreover, using
Boost just for
wrapping<br>
C++ with Python does not seem to be an appropriate solution. <br>
<h4>Kernel wrapping
</h4>
<p>Connecting the Kernel with Python was pretty fast.&nbsp; The only
encountered problem was with down-casting operations. The Kernel have
STL<br>
containers of pointers. <br>
For example, a NSDS stores the
dynamical systems, but does not know their specific types. So it is
impossible to access the type of dynamical <br>
system after a
down-casting operation (static_cast and dynamic_cast in C++). This
operation is not allowed by Python. To solve this problem, <br>
a
cast method&nbsp; has been written in each class which is not a base
class. This method wraps
the C++ operator of dynamic casting and returns <br>
a pointer on the class.
<br>
</p>
<p>The connection of STL containers is not fully automatic. A Python
type has to be defined for each data type stored in such a
container. <br>
This type definition must be placed in the interface file.
For example, to be able to use a container of pointers on Dynamical
systems,&nbsp; <br>
the following command has to be added in the Swig
interface file: </p>
<pre>%include "std_vector.i";<br>namespace std {<br> %template(dsVector) vector&lt;DynamicalSystem*&gt;;<br>}<br></pre>
<h4>How to add new functions or classes in Python interface?</h4>
<br>
The "wrapping" file is <span style="font-weight: bold;">FrontEnd/python/pySiconos.i
. </span><br>
To have access to functions or classes of Siconos/Kernel,&nbsp; the
corresponding header files should be added in this&nbsp;<a
 href="../../Front-End/python/pySiconos.i">pySiconos.i</a>&nbsp;
file.&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h4>Miscellaneous
</h4>
<p>In Swig last version (1.3.23, 1.3.24), a bug makes the compilation
of the interface failed. This is a simple syntax error and we
wrote a bash <br>
script to correct this. This bug should be fixed soon in
Swig distributions.<br>
