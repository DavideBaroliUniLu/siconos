\section{Contents of the Verification and Validation plan}



The Verification and Validation plan is divided into three phases :
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Unit testing Plan}: In the phase of unit tests, one  verify that the software subsystems and components work
correctly in isolation, and as specified in the detailed design (see \ac{ddd}). The set of unit tests
  are defined for each increment in the Chapter~\ref{Sec:QP-PRUT}.
\item \textbf{Integration testing plan}: In the phase of
  integration tests, one verify that the major software components
  work correctly with the rest of the system, and as specified in the
  architectural design (see \ac{add}). The set of integration tests
  are defined for each increment in the Chapter~\ref{Sec:QP-PRIT}.
  
\item \textbf{System and Acceptance testing  plan}: In the phase acceptance
  tests, one verify that the software system meets the user
  requirements (see \ac{srd} and \ac{esd}). The set of acceptance
  tests are defined for each increment in the Chapter~\ref{Sec:QP-PRAT}.
\end{enumerate}

These verification activities demonstrate compliance
specifications. This may be done by showing that the product:
performs as specified;
contains no defects that prevent it performing as specified.

The results of the verification and validation plan will be found in
the \ac{qr}.


\section{Organisation of the reviews to meet the plan}
Reviews and meeting are regularly organized to present the work done.
People concerned by these reviews are all the development team members and also the persons in charge of the development team.\\

That's the group leader who manages reviews and decides the main goal of the review.So call-conference are organised between the \ac{inria} (Grenoble) and the \ac{lmgc} (Montpellier). Moreover, meetings are planned in one or the other city.\\

During these reviews, the accomplished work is presented and present people must have read the new or modified documents.
