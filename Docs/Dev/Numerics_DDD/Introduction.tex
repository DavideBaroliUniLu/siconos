\label{Sec:DDD-Purpose}
The purpose of the Detailled Design Document is to specify completely the data structure of \ac{numerics}. It relies on the \ac{ssd} and its Architecture Design chapters.\\

\section{Scope}
\label{Sec:DDD-Scope}

This project is a work-package of European project \ac{SICONOS}. \\
Besides the standard features which are required for a software of scientific computing, the objectives of this project are of the following~:
\begin{itemize}
\item To be able to rely on existing developments. \ac{numerics} will not re-implement already existing dedicated tools such as \ac{ode} pack, ...
\item To support exchanges and comparisons of methods between researchers.
\item To disseminate the know-how to other fields of research and industry.
\item To take into account the diversity of users (end users, algorithms developers).
\end{itemize}
