\section about About
The Siconos Platform is a scientific computing software dedicated to the modeling, simulation, control and analysis of <b>Non Smooth Dynamical Systems (NSDS)</b>.
This project belongs to the European project <a href="http://siconos.inrialpes.fr/"> SICONOS</a> , dedicated to the modeling,
the control the analysis and the simulation of the so-called "Non Smooth Dynamical system".\n
\subsection MainObj What are the main objectives and motivations?
Besides the standard features which are required for a software of scientific computing, the objectives of this project are of the
following :
- To provide a common framework (modeling and simulation tools)
for non smooth problems present in various scientific fields : applied
Mathematics, Mechanics, Robotics, Electrical networks, etc.
- To be able to rely on existing developments, as well for the
modeling tools as for the simulation tools. The platform will not
re-implement the dedicated tools, which are already used for the
modeling of specific systems in various fields,but will provide a
framework to their integration. In the same way, we want to re-use
improved numerical low-level routines.
- To support exchanges and comparisons of methods between
researchers.
- To disseminate the know-how to other fields of research and
industry.
- To take into account the diversity of users (end users,
experts, software developers, framework builders,
industrial users, etc ... ).
- To set up standards in terms of modeling of the NSDS.
-To ensure software quality by the use of modern software design
methods.
