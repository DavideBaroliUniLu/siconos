=== Web pages generation  (siconos.gforge.inria.fr) ===

Directories in (BASE = siconos/trunk/Docs/ ...)

- Siconos Home Page -> BASE/SiconosWeb

- Getting Started With Siconos -> BASE/Users/GettingStarted

- Installation Guide -> BASE/Users/SiconosInstall


Process:
In each of the directories above, launch doxywizard, load the .cfg file 
which is in the related config directory, and start doc generation. 

This will result in html pages generation in BASE/htdocs.

- BASE/htdocs/index.html: Siconos Home Page
- BASE/htdocs/GettingStarted/index.html: Getting Started With Siconos main page
- BASE/htdocs/SiconosInstallindex.html: Installation Guide main page

In the same way, run doxywizard in Numerics and Kernel for sources documentation.
Results:
- BASE/htdocs/Doxygen/index.html for Kernel API documentation.
- BASE/htdocs/DoxygenNumerics/index.html for Numerics API documentation.

The css is in BASE/css directory.
All figures must be in BASE/htdocs/figures. 

The latex corresponding files are in BASE/.../latex directory. Run make to generate a pdf document (refMan.pdf).

Transfer to Gforge: 

scp -pr htdocs/* login@siconos.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/siconos/htdocs

-p option for first commit only => allow to keep same files permissions (rw|rw|r) after sending. 


Warning: if you generate latex or xml do not transfer it!
