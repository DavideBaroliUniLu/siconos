This chapter will explain the various way to save the data contained in the platform.
Two main storage methods are possible.

\section{Complete save with \ac{xml} files}
In this case, the users use the \acs{api}'s methods.\\
The user has a dedicated method of the \ac{api} to manage the \ac{xml} output file writing. The method "saveToXMLFile" saves the data of the platform in the \ac{dom} tree, checks if the data are coherent and then write the \ac{xml} file.
\begin{ndr}
	The method "saveToXMLFile" is not yet compatible with the save of the data at each time step, we must give it a name for the file to save...
\end{ndr}
The user has only to call this method when he wants, for example, in the simulation loop, he can save the data each $n$ steps.

\section{Partial results}
In this case, the users manage the data save as he wants. He selects some information, can make computation with them, and then, he can save them in an ascii file. So the users have to use basic C++ functions.\\
The user has to work to create these output files. But he can do what he wants, he can use all the data of the platform, make computations with them and save his calculation in a file.
