The \ac{siconos} platform is dedicated to the modelling and simulation of \ac{nsds}. For modelling part, several canonical model for \ac{nsds}, relations and non-smooth laws can be used. For the simulation part, robust time integration method (time stepping, event driven) of the dynamics and numerical solvers for non smooth laws can be used.

The \ac{siconos} platform can be used as a library.

The numerical routine for computation is provide by plugin. Each user can develop his own plugin and use it

The \ac{siconos} platform can take as input file an \ac{xml} file which describe the system. The platform can formalise the input file into canonical model, and analyse the coherence of the data. It can make an \ac{xml} file in order to save the state of the system during and / or after the simulation.

Expert user can modify the platform and add some functionality, because this platform is open source. Some documents will help developers (\ac{ddd}, \ac{esd}, \ac{anp}, ...)

\textbf{
In this version of \ac{siconos}, for driving a simulation, the user have to write a command file (in C++). This file creates dynamical systems, interactions, \dots run the simulation and collect informations.
