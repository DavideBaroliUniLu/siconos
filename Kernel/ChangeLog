before it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v1.0 - October 2005 (release 341)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       - add modeling of Lagrangian (non linear) relations + related simulation part
	 and cppunit tests + general review of all kind of relations.
       - Insure tests ok
