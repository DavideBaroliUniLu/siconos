\section sect_plat Platforms

Siconos v1.3.0 has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:
- Linux/Unix gcc2.95.x, gcc3.x, gcc4.x
- Mac OS X (note: this platform required to set 
  FLIBS="-L/sw/lib -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lSystem" before 
  the ./configure completed successfully.)

If you have compiled Siconos on another platform successfully, then
the maintainer would be glad to hear about that.
