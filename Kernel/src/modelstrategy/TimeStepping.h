//
//_ Integration of the new version of the SiconosVector in the platform. the class simpleVector is used mostly to replace old SiconosVector. When a vector can be composite or simple, like the state of a dynamical system, a pointer on SiconosVector is used, and the vector is initialized simple or composite when the system is initialized.

//_ All the tests which worked with the previous version of the vector are OK with the new version.

//_ Example SICONOS and bouncingBall are OK
//
//_ some comments have still to be adapted to NewSiconosVector .
//
//_ This version of NewSiconosVector could be called 0.9. some details have to be fixed, it will be done before the end of September.
