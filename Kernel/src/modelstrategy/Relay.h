//_ Integration of the new version of the SiconosVector in the platform. the class simpleVector is used mostly to replace old SiconosVector. When a vector can be composite or simple, like the state of a dynamical system, a pointer on SiconosVector is used, and the vector is initialized simple or composite when the system is initialized.
