/** First order linear systems - Inherits from DynamicalSystems
 *
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 2.0.1.
 *  \date (Creation) Apr 29, 2004
 *
 *
 *  This class represents first order linear systems of the form:
 * \f[
 * \dot x = Ax(t)+T u(t)+b+r,
 *  x(t_0)=x_0
 * \f]
 * where
 *    - \f$x \in R^{n} \f$ is the state,
 *    - \f$r \in R^{n} \f$  the input due to the Non Smooth Interaction.
 *
 *  The  rhs is specialized by
 *    - \f$A \in R^{n\times n} \f$
 *    - \f$b \in R^{n} \f$
 *    - \f$u \in R^{uSize} \f$
 *    - \f$T \in R^{n\times uSize} \f$
 *        warning: T and u are members of DynamicalSystem class.
 *
 * The "minimal" form is
 * \f[
 * \dot x = Ax(t),
 *  x(t_0)=x_0
 * \f]
 * and so A should always be specified.
 *
 * This class inherits from LinearDS one. The difference is that here A and b do not depends on time.
 *
 * Links with DynamicalSystem are:
 *
 * \f[
 *   f(x,t) = Ax(t) + b /  / , / /
 *   jacobianX = A
 * \f]
 *
 * A and b are constant matrix or vector, and thus can not be set using a plug-in.
 * Setting a value to A, automatically set jacobianX.
 *
 * To build and use a linearDS, you first need to call a constructor, with A as a required data.
 * Then, this system has to be initialized -> compute members value at time t0. This is usually done during call to simulation->initialize.
 * Finally, the state of the DS can be obtained by calling "compute" functions. In LinearTIDS case, since A and b are fixed, you can
 * only call computeRhs(time), to compute rhs = Ax+b+Tu.
