# //
# //  DiodeBridge  : sample of an electrical circuit involving :
# //	- a linear dynamical system consisting of an LC oscillator (1 ÂµF , 10 mH)
# //	- a non smooth system (a 1000 Ohm resistor supplied through a 4 diodes bridge) in parallel
# //	  with the oscillator
# //
# //  Expected behavior : 
# //	The initial state (Vc = 10 V , IL = 0) of the oscillator provides an initial energy.
# //	The period is 2 Pi sqrt(LC) ~ 0,628 ms.
# //      The non smooth system is a full wave rectifier :
# //	each phase (positive and negative) of the oscillation allows current to flow
# //	through the resistor in a constant direction, resulting in an energy loss :
# //	the oscillation damps.
# //
# //  State variables : 
# //	- the voltage across the capacitor (or inductor)
# //	- the current through the inductor
# //
# //  Since there is only one dynamical system, the interaction is defined by :
# //	- complementarity laws between diodes current and voltage. Depending on
# //        the diode position in the bridge, y stands for the reverse voltage across the diode 
# //	  or for the diode current (see figure in the template file) 
# //	- a linear time invariant relation between the state variables and
# //	  y and lambda (derived from Kirchhoff laws)
# //
