\section EMIntro Foreword

This documents is a collection of description of all the available samples in Siconos platform. \n
For each documented example, it provides a detailed description of the physical problem and gives some comments on the corresponding
implementation. \n

Categories of examples are:
- Electronics
- Mechanics

Each sample is also identified thanks to a list of keywords, given at the beginning of the example description. 

Then, for each example, you get:
- a page with a complete description of the problem, the way it is implemented and so on: see "Related pages" tab on top of page for a complete lists of all available samples. 
- a link to the source code and a short reference file documentation, see the Files/file list tab on top of page.

\section EMAbout About this documentation
On top of this page, you get links to the Siconos Home Page and to some other documents. \n
On the left, the summary with:
- a list of all commented examples
- a list of all the namespaces (if documented) used in Siconos Samples.
- a list of all the documented files in Siconos Samples. It provides a short description of each sample and some links to the source code and to the detailed documentation page.
- Directories: files hierarchy in Siconos Samples

\section EMHowTo How to Write a new sample

Each time a new example is developed and distributed with the Siconos platform, do:

-# Create a new directory for your sample
-# In this directory write either a .cpp, a .py or a .sci input file, depending on the process type you choose (C++, Python or Scilab). For details on how to write an input file, see \ref gettingStarted "Getting Started with Siconos". 
-# Add the optional files ( plugin, xml ...)
-# Write a result.gp file, to automate plots of some results of the simulation with gnuplot (see example in Mechanics/BouncingBall/ location). 
-# Write a documentation file (.dox, see below)

\subsection EMWriteDoc Writing your own documentation file

The Manual is generated thanks to Doxygen. This results in html pages and/or latex files to build a pdf version of the documentation. \n

First of all, read <a href="http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr/homePageAboutDoc.html">About this Documentation</a> page to learn how to use Doxygen with Siconos. 

Then the process is:

-# in the directory where your sample input files are located, create a mySample.dox file. It must looks like:
\verbatim
/** \page labelOfYourSample TitleOfYourSample

\author author's name

\b Keywords: a list of keywords. At least the dynamical systems, non-smooth law and 
relations types, the simulation and the OneStepNSProblem types.

\b Location: sample directory.

\b Code: the cpp file(s) related to this sample.

\date the date of creation ...

\section labelSection1 section1Title
A first section where you give a detailed description of the considered problem.

\section labelSection2 section2Title
A second section where you describe the implementation of your problem in Siconos

\section labelSection3 section3Title
The results of the simulation.
*/
\endverbatim
See for example the dox file in Samples/Mechanics/CamFollower/ to have an overview of the main commands and \ref EMCamFollower to see the resulting page. \n
For details on all the doxygen commands see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html . 
-# Save the figures you need in Samples/figures, possibly with some subdirectories. \n
For example, to include a figure myFigure, saved in Samples/figures/mySample: 
\verbatim
\image html mySample/myFigure.png "caption" width=5cm
\image latex mySample/myFigure.eps "caption" widht=5cm
\endverbatim
which means that each figure must be saved in png and eps format. The two commands are required: one to include the picture in html pages and another for latex/pdf. \n
For the figure directory, please keep the same files tree as in Samples (i.e. if your sample is in Samples/Mechanics/MySample, save your figures in Samples/figures/Mechanics/MySample).
-# Document .cpp input file with Doxygen. At least the GNU-license header and a brief description of the sample:
\verbatim

/*! \file mySample.cpp 
\brief \ref labelOfYourSample - Brief comments - Author(s).
Some more comments if required.
*/
\endverbatim
For example, the header in CamFollower.cpp is: 
\verbatim
/*!\file CamFollowerNoXML.cpp 
\brief \ref EMCamFollower - C++ input file version - M. di Bernardo, G. Osorio, S. Santini.
*/
\endverbatim
EMCamFollower being the label on top of CamFollower.dox file. 
Then, in tab files/file list on top of page you will get:
\image html filesList.png
\image latex filesList.eps "" width=4cm
From left to right:
	- the name of the file, a link to the file.cpp file reference which provide the detailed (optional) description and a depency graph.
	- [code] a link to the full source code 
	- a link to the documentation (from .dox) named "Simulation of a Cam Follower System"
	- comments and authors names.
-# Add an entry in the Contents section of ExampleManual.dox, relative to you sample. 
-# Generate the files as explained in the next section.

\subsection EMGenDoc Generation of Examples Manual

\b Warning: you need doxygen 1.5.1, doxywizard and maybe graphviz utilities to process with doxygen documentation.
For details on doxygen and related tools download and install, see <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/install.html#install_bin_unix">Doxygen Installation Page</a>.\n

First of all, if it does not exist, create the directory "Samples/../GeneratedDocs". 

Then, to generate the documentation, from Samples directory, launch doxywizard, and follow the steps:
-# load config/SiconosExamples.cfg 
-# "start" generation. 

Then you can open Samples/../GeneratedDocs/Samples/index.html with any web browser.

To generate latex, from doxywizard:
-# load config/SiconosExamples.cfg, choose Expert and in "LaTex" tab, tick GENERATE_LATEX.
-# save in config/SiconosExamples.cfg
-# start

A latex directory is then created in Samples/../GeneratedDocs/Samples. From this location, type "make" to obtain refman.pdf, the pdf version of the Manual.

If you do not want to use doxywizard, just run from config directory:
\verbatim
doxygen SiconosExamples.cfg
\endverbatim
