Matlab interface routines.





The using procedure:

0) Open a matlab session

1) For compile the interface main_xxxlab.c and use the xxx type of problem, make:
	  mex -DMEXFLAG main_xxxlab.c 
   
2) Example:
  
   We want to solve a LCP problem thanks to the Lemke solver:
   
   
>> [z,w,info]=main_lcplab(M,q,itermax,tol,'Lemke',k_latin)


LCP problem:

	  M z - w = q
	  0<= z , w => 0
	  z' w = 0

Inputs:
   M is the matrix of the LCP
   q is the vector of the LCP
   itermax is the maximum of iterations required
   tol is the tolerance value
   'Lemke' the solver using for solve the LCP
   k_latin is the search direction of the Latin method (optional for the others solvers)

Outputs:

   z and w the solution vectors of the LCP
   info an integer that give you the termination reason (0: successful, 1 otherwise)
