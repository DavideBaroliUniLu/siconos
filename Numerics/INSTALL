 How to load and install the platform (Numerics, Kernel, Front-End):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---++ Required external libraries

   * libxml2
      * actual version used with the platform : 2.6.17
      * last version : 2.6.17 
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

   * lapack++
      * actual version used with the platform: 2.4.0
      * last version : 2.4.0
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://sourceforge.net/projects/lapackpp

---++ Optional external libraries (advised for developers)

   * nana
      * actual version used with the platform: 2.5
      * last version : 2.5
      * known problems : compilation problems
      * location : Gforge

   * cppunit
      * actual version used with the platform: 1.10.2
      * last version : 1.10.2
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi


---++ Getting the sources

   * Through the svn server (acess required)
       svn checkout svn+ssh://user@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/siconos
       for more explanation see http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9
   * Download the source packages on the Gforge   


---++ INSTALL 

For each package (Numerics, Kernel, Front-End, in this order), in the corresponding main directory:
	
	- ./reconf.sh
	- configure --prefix="the path where you want to install the platform" --other_options
	- make
	- make install (default install location: /usr/local) 
	- make check (optional) : to run tests	
	- make documentation (optional)  : to generate Doxygen documentation

for more details on configure options, type configure --help. 
      
---+++ Is the installation of the Kernel OK ?
   * You can try to run : cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/BouncingBall ; siconos BouncingBall.cpp

---+++ Is the installation of the Font-End OK ?
   * You can try to run : cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/BouncingBall ; pySiconos BouncingBall.py

   * *I advise you for the moment to install the platform in the directory retrieved from SVN. C++ compiler, System libraries, external libraries, etc. are tested...

   * If you have a local installation of an external library, you can give its path to configure with the option --with-local[library name]. You can get the possible options typing =%configure --help=.
